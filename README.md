Was there anything out of the ordinary that we should know about?

**You can try using our Environmental Mapping implementation by going to Render Camera under the "Use Environment Map" box and import any CubeMap of your choice.

## Feedback

About how long did you and your partners (if any) spend on this project?

**25 hours**

What was the hardest part about this project?

**There were several parts which took us some time. We ran into many precision problems using RAY_EPSILON.**

Is there anything you would change about this project?

**I would include more details in testing each checkpoint. It was hard for us to determine whether we got the checkpoint right or not and there were times where we weren't sure which parts wasn't working properly due to that.**
