What was the hardest part about this project?

**There were several parts which took us some time. We ran into many precision problems using RAY_EPSILON.**

Is there anything you would change about this project?

**I would include more details in testing each checkpoint. It was hard for us to determine whether we got the checkpoint right or not and there were times where we weren't sure which parts wasn't working properly due to that.**
